I am a city boy, born and raised.

As I get older, and watch my children grow, I realize that I have missed out on a great deal of what our surroundings have to offer, and thus have less that I can teach them about the amazing world they live in. 

While I have never been a camper, hiker, or general outdoorsman, I want my children to grow up knowing nature and the self-confidence that comes with the skills learned out in it. As a person who constantly looks to push my own boundaries, I have decided to undertake the journey to become more experienced out in the wild. 

This is the first post my journey as I venture out of the city to learn new skills, try new tools, and teach my kids (and myself) to love the great American outdoors.
